# signupform
This project will be a page  resembling a sign-up form that many sites contain.

It will only be using vanilla HTML and CSS.

The form validation is all done with vanilla HTML, no JavaScript is used.

This will demonstrate my current vanilla HTML and CSS skills, but mainly my current ability to make/style forms.
